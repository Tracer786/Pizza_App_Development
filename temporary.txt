Making the directory structure
We will install the yarn package in it
Initialize the yarn package using the command "yarn init"
It will ask some question to the user
In order to skip the questions we can use the command "yarn init -y" or "yarn init -yes"

Here yarn is used to create the .json file which otherwise we had to create manually

If we are using NPM we simply need to type the command "npm init"

yarn.lock file is used to keep the enteries of version of the dependencies 
If we are using NPM we will get the entry as package-json.lock
